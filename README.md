# Alarmium

# A team of three students, Anna Singer, Sidney Taylor and Shifa Somji, from Harvey Mudd College co-founded Alarmium in June 2020, aiming for connecting friends and family with group alarms. 

# Set alarms and share them with a group to remind others of an event.

# Git clone the repository.
# In the repo directory, run "npm install" to install dependencies
# Run "expo start" to initiate expo. Then, you will see instructions to run a demo on a real device or a simulator.
